- Assumptions&Limitations

I assume that after each player completes their turn, the doctor will move. This allows the doctor to move to more rooms and makes the game more interesting. I also assume that when a player chooses to "look around," the player information and tool information for each neighboring room will be displayed one by one. If the doctor is also in the room, the health of the doctor will be displayed as well.  
I have strict requirements for the format of the specification file. If the input file does not adhere to the specified format, the program may not run correctly. Additionally, if players do not follow the prompts for input, the program may also not be able to continue properly.
